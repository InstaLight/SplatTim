# Splat Tim (Modified Kurisu)
A Discord server bot by 916253 and ihaveamac/ihaveahax. Designed heavily around the [Nintendo Homebrew Discord](https://discord.gg/C29hYvh).
Although it is open source, this bot is not really designed to be used in other setups at the moment; the source is mainly just available for those interested in how it works on the Nintendo Homebrew server.

Modified by Zewia and Sentry to work for the private Splat Tim discord server and a is a easier to modify for use with other servers but not reccomended.
NOTE, a lot of Kurisu's code has been deleted cause we didnt need it if you need it or want it please get for Kurisu's github
